            "two jackets on project, a suggestion from boris johnson about the dress code and before long the leaders- a mocking president, putin, canadian prime minister- suggest they should mimic the russian leader by taking their shirts off to and going horse riding as he has done. beyond the jokes, the leaders of the world's richest countries that gathering to work out what's the next about ukraine. there are differences of emphasis in approach. hear about how much and for how long ukraine should be helped. the uk insists it must be for the long haul. the prime minister acknowledges, though some a tiring of it. i think that the pressure is there and the anxiety is that we gotta be honest about that. the g seven has been solid a we continue to be solid, but in order to protect that unity, in order to to make it work, you gotta have a really, really honest discussions about the implications of what's going on. these two men looked like the best friend of a year old, but in private, the prime minister emphasize to the french president: any attempt to settle the conflict now, with russia having stolen ukrainian territory, would be a mistake. at this summit, the aim is to portray as much unity and resolve as possible as the conflict in ukraine drugs on and it's costs back home, not least rising prices, become more obvious, president biden, in conversation with the summit house, the german chancellor stressed a sense of togetherness was imperative. to stay together is true. loose flute, counting on from the beginning, it would use of splintered, countless aggression. take the fundamental. true for all of the leaders here is the democratic pressures that they face back home from that parties and that public. boris johnson is well aware of this. of course this matters because the leaders of the mold and flex their views to reflect their domestic audience, unlike their opponents, president, person who does not have. the challenge then is how to stand together, how to move as warm- not easy and not guaranteed in the long term. or that's because at some point they will have to be a discussion about what would be an acceptable position for talks to start between ukraine and russia. where would the different western powers find themselves on that key question and at what stage? and in the meantime, the consequences and the costs of the war continue in ukraine and beyond.\n"
